### v6.1.2
### **Checksummed and Optimized**
---
* Update moose tracker to v4.0.1. This update reduces log pollution from moose as it reduces log severity.

---
<br>


### v6.1.1
### **Checksummed and Optimized**
---
* Update moose tracker to v4.0.0. Which adds the previously missing `path_id` field in the `transfer_file` event

---
<br>

### v6.1.0
### **Checksummed and Optimized**
---
* Introduce `ChecksumStarted`, `ChecksumProgress`, and `ChecksumFinished` events on the downloader side when resuming and after the download.
* Add the `checksum_events_size_treshold_bytes` optional config field for controlling the threshold of file size after which the checksum events are emited.
* Optimize `transfers_since()`

---
<br>

### v6.0.0
### **Connection Clarity**
---
* New API `norddrop_network_refresh` to inform Libdrop that network configuration or peer
availability has changed. This breaks the previous automated retry behavior where it automatically issued 
requests and now waits for this API to be called to conserve the resources.
* Introduce server side authentication
* Ensure `norddrop_stop()` blocks until all events are processed by the handler.
* Normalize file paths upon receiving the transfer request immedieatly, thus eliminate misleading file names in the events.
* Introduce `TransferThrottled` event for file uploads

---
<br>

### v5.4.0
### **Unforeseen Moose**
---
* Update moose tracker to v2.0.0
* Add `moose_app_version` field to config
* Add timestamps to emitted events
* Add DLL signing to Windows builds

---
<br>

### v5.3.0
### **Tungsten Bullet**
---
* Fix the problem where sometimes the `FileDownloaded` event was not emitted when the peers were disconnecting rapidly
* Ensure outstanding file streaming tasks are finished before removing temporary files. Add more logging around temporary files handling
* Try to remove temporary files right away in the case of rejection 
* Update the rustc to 1.72.1

---
<br>

### v5.2.0
### **Golden Bullet**
---
* Use unbounded events queue in order to disable back pressure on the connection handlers in case the event callback blocks.
* Improve the suppression of the `TransferRequest` and `TransferCancelled` event pair for cancelled transfers.
* Fix same named directories being merged on the sender side
* Disallow transfers with no files in them

---
<br>

### v5.1.0
### **Silver Bullet**
---
* Suppress synchronization of transfers cancelled before the receiver got a chance to receive the transfer request.\
This fixes the case when transfer cancelled on the sender side caused `TransferCancelled` being fired immedieatly after `TransferRequest`.\
With this change the transfer would not be seen on the receiver side at all.
* Implement a periodic transfer state check in case of stalled transfer for the receiver
* Fix occasional events reordering, for example file done swapped transfer cancelation, on the sender side 
* Fix repeated `FileDone` events on the sender, when reconnecting to the  receiver.
