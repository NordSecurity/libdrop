### v5.2.0
### **Golden Bullet**
---
* Use unbounded events queue in order to disable back pressure on the connection handlers in case the event callback blocks.
* Improve the suppression of the `TransferRequest` and `TransferCancelled` event pair for cancelled transfers.

---
<br>

### v5.1.0
### **Silver Bullet**
---
* Suppress synchronization of transfers cancelled before the receiver got a chance to receive the transfer request.\
This fixes the case when transfer cancelled on the sender side caused `TransferCancelled` being fired immedieatly after `TransferRequest`.\
With this change the transfer would not be seen on the receiver side at all.
* Implement a periodic transfer state check in case of stalled transfer for the receiver
* Fix occasional events reordering, for example file done swapped transfer cancelation, on the sender side 
* Fix repeated `FileDone` events on the sender, when reconnecting to the  receiver.
